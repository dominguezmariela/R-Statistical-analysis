# R Programming and Statistical Foundations

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of R scripts developed for learning and applying
fundamental concepts in programming and statistics, with a focus on data handling,
probability distributions, and simulation.

The scripts reflect hands-on practice in data analysis workflows commonly used in
public health, biostatistics, and quantitative research.
